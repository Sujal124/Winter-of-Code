# Winter-of-Code

Data Structures & Algorithms made easy
The Winter of Code  is a program aimed to increase participation for the Google Summer of Code program among students in colleges and universities. .


The project aims to contribute to the repository of NeoAlgo in TesseractCoding organisation consisting of Data Structures and Algorithms in different languages of Computer Science. The objective is:
1) To bring all possible Data Structures and Algorithms under one roof in different languages of computer science. 

2) With the aid and assistance of different possible Data Structures and Algorithms, the coding will be done in such a fashion that the code will be optimised and efficient in terms of time and space complexity. Alongside, adding comments to the codes is one of the priority as it would eventually improve the Readibility of the program.

3) Documenting the code along with the output is one of the essential aim and henceforth contributing to the open source.

1.2 Feasibility & Scope
Given the largest scope of the project and the diverse ambit of the Data Structures and Algorithms,it becomes critical and crucial to desribe the boundaries of the stuff which are 
-DSA is constantly evolving:  
Implementation is not that difficult , work is easy to implement but the main point is designing is where it takes time. We need to use optimum algorithm or the limited available resources.
This is main fulcrum majority of the companies hire engineers in this way. It allows us to use available resources in an optimized fashion. 


-Technical Details:

Using Data Structures and Algorithms, it becomes fairly and squarely easy. But coding in an efficient and optimised fashion using DSA with appropriate space and time complexity isn't an easy thing to do.

This specific approach was chosen because of the following reasons:

1)The program should be maintainable
The most standard Data Structures and Algorithms will be added to the repository of NeoAlgo in the language of . It offers  flexibility.


2)Modularity and Proper Object Oriented Programming will be strictly followed in order to code according to the standard practices.  Optimised and Efficient Approach will be followed with efficient time and space complexity.

3.Syntax Analyser & Semantic Analyser will be shown.

For instance: Following oops
Abstraction using access specifiers 






 

4) Design: programs in accordance to standard Data Structures and Algorithms will be constructed according to the design. Design implies coding will be done with pre-thought process in order to evade errors as thoughts are cheaper than debugging. 

5) Elegance: Sounds weird when it comes to coding or programming but elegance is essentially Beauty in the code. Stuff like following proper  indentation in the code coupled with simplicity and Effeciency will be followed while contributing
 

I used Algorithms by Sedgwick (Moderate) Data Structures and Algorithms made easy by Narasimha Karumanchi as a reference to while coding the data structures and algorithms . Also Love Babbar’s repository.
6)Using Standard Template Library (STL) : STL is apparently powerful template library and template functions that implements many common Data Structures and Algorithms easily, removing the chunk of complexity.
7)Object Oriented Programming
It's faster and easier to execute. One of the lethal advantage of usage of OOPS is that it follows the approach of DRY(Don't Repeat yourself). We can extract the chunk of codes for the common application.


COMMUNITY BONDING


Get in touch with my project mentor, introduce myself, workout a good time to communicate (taking into account timezone differences and their schedule).

Ask the mentor for any suggestions/changes to the project. The project proposal reflects my knowledge as of writing, there may be essential amendments neccessary and it would be better to make them early.
Go through the 	NeoAlgo code base again. Make notes of which tokens: - datatypes, identifiers, punctuation marks, keywords etc are used most often. Some of them may be functions defined only inside certain libraries, pay special attention to those.

Go through all the example programs given in the Github Repository, the inbuilt examples are what we'll be using as a template for a basic Data Structures and Algorithms  program, so it is essential to get familiar with them.

Get in touch with other WOCer's .

PHASE 1: 10th December - 20th December
Majority of the languages in the repository such as Python and C++ has got major chunk of DSA covered. However the repositories of  languages such as C-Sharp and Go doesn't have much of the DSA part covered. Although repositories in  languages such as Python and C++ got the DSA but the variety of questions are missing. My work will enhance the repository by adding more questions on different DSA. Moreover advanced DSA are missing which are critical and crucial for competitive programming. Also documentation will be done.

VI. Do you have any commitments during the WoC Period?
None whatsoever. My University will be closed for the entire period due to the Winter 
V. Why this project
I chose NeoAlgo because I am fascinated by Data Structures and Algorithms in general. Knowing building logic, having proper grip on the DSA concepts coupled with syntax of a language coding together allows a person to be able to build whatever they can concievably think of! I am very grateful to the  community for bringing around the maker movement, without it, I couldn't dream of knowing as much electronics as I do now. It will have a huge impact on the community as apparently everone learnsDSA at one point of time and they will find everything organised under one roof.
A chance to be a part of an open source commmunity: Most of my projects are based around hackathons. I have not had the opportunity to work in a large scale open source organisation, and this is an opportunity to get introduced to open source along with mentorship.
